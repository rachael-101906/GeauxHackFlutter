Splitting tasks effectively in a hackathon between two people requires clear communication, leveraging each person's strengths, and staying adaptable. Here's a simple approach to divide responsibilities:

## Define Roles Based on Strengths

Person A: Focus on backend development (e.g., APIs, databases, server-side logic) if they are skilled in programming logic or server-side technologies.

Person B: Handle frontend development (e.g., UI/UX design, user interaction, and visuals) if they are creative or experienced in design tools and frameworks.


## Divide Tasks by Workflow Stages

Person A: Research and brainstorm the technical feasibility of the idea, set up the project structure, and handle core functionalities.

Person B: Create wireframes/mockups, design the user interface, and integrate the frontend with the backend.


## Share Non-Technical Responsibilities

Both: Collaborate on brainstorming the idea, pitching, and testing the final product.
Split tasks like:

Documentation: One person writes the technical details, while the other focuses on the presentation or pitch deck.
Presentation: One can present the technical aspects, while the other explains the user experience and design.




By staying in sync through regular check-ins and using tools like Trello or Notion to track progress, you can ensure a smooth collaboration. Remember, flexibility is key—be ready to adjust tasks as needed!
